Hey There

I'm currently an Infrastructure Engineer at Warby Parker, an eyewear company transforming the industry.

After finishing my undergraduate degree at Syracuse University I moved to New York City to start my carreer in technology. Currently at Warby Parker I'm a member of a two person team that supports the office technology behind a company of over 300 people.

I enjoy working on passionate teams and breathing life into whacky ideas. I love to combine technical and creative minds to see what can be built.
