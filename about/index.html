        <p>Hey Thereâ€”</p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m currently a Staff Infrastructure Engineer at
          <a href="https://ro.co">Ro</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          After finishing my undergraduate degree at Syracuse University in 2013
          I moved to New York City to start my career in technology. Currently
          Iâ€™m a member of a small team that manages the development
          infrastructure, cloud instances, and dev tooling at Ro.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my personal time, I like to take photos, build silly and profane
          apps, and give talks at local meetups.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy working on passionate teams and breathing life into wacky
          ideas. I love to combine technical and creative minds to see what can
          be built.
