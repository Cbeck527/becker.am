This Thanksgiving, my family and I had the opportunity to visit my sister while
she was studying abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. This was my first time going
abroad since I studied in London in 2011. Needless to say, I was very excited to
visit Denmark and see Katie, but I was less-than-ecstatic about the 8 hour
flight to and from.

While we were there, I shot two rolls of film. I ended up running out of film
and didn't have a backup! Almost magically, we turned the corner
and [Photografica](http://www.photografica.com/) was there waiting for me. I ran
inside and was able to pick up a roll of
[AgfaPhoto Vista 400](http://www.agfaphoto.org/appc/content_manager/page.php?ID=193740&dbc=c354311afdec5ba2db31a90894620a96).
I was super unfamiliar with this stock, so some of my images came out pretty
dark. Thankfully, I was able to rescue most of them in Lightroom.

One of my favorite days was when we visited Christiansborg Palace. The artwork
and architecture was so intricate and beautiful. We must have gone at a very
unpopular time, because we basically had the entire palace to ourselves. It was
surreal to

Fun fact: this is the 3rd palace that has been built. The first two burned down
in fires. I was initially really impressed by how clean and modern everything
looked, but then I learned that they had two chances to make it nice!

On our last night, we spent some time in Denmark's most famous amusement park,
Tivoli. This park was also an inspiration for Walt Disney's Disney Land!
