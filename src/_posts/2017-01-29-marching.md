The past two weekends after Donald Trump took office have been filled with love, compassion, and activism.

The first march that I, and thousands of other New Yorkers, attended was
the [Women's March on NYC](https://www.facebook.com/events/1601810850126741). I
was honored to march with my sister Claire, and some of her friends from
Fordham.

After the recent "Muslim Ban," as it will be remembered, impromptu protesting
broke out at JFK airport in NYC and a march was formed in the Financial
District. By the time I had heard about the protest at JFK, the Port Authority
had suspended all AirTrain service making getting there almost impossible.
However, the march downtown was still a possibility.

I had to be there.

I texted a few friends and within a few minutes everyone responded. Without
hesitation, everyone committed.

So we went.
