It's no secret that I like trains... a lot. I live in the Upper East side that
has been historically constrained with only one train system: 4/5/6 Lexington
Avenue Line. On January 1st, 2017 the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway
was opened for straphangers!

A few weeks later on a snowy Saturday night, I took the Q train from Lexington
Ave/63rd St up to the end at 96 St/2 Av, and documented the journey.

96th street is the end of the line, so the train car emptied out.
