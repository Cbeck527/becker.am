In October 2015, I was fortunate enough to be able to take a trip to the Pacific
Northwest. I attended [HashiConf
2015](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashiconf-wrap-up.html) at the end of
September, and took the rest of the week off to explore Portland and Seattle.
Chelsea met up with me after the conference was finished.

Being the hipster that I am, I decided to channel my inner-Portlandia and
document my trip on film.

At this point, it was time to jump into a tiny propeller plane and venture north
to Seattle! My good friends [Anne Marie](https://twitter.com/annemariePNW) and
[Adam](https://twitter.com/adamcohenSU) were already there, ready to have a
great time. Anne Marie was kind enough to host us, and Adam flew up from LA to
meet us.

It would be remiss of me not to include a picture of a west coast sunset:
