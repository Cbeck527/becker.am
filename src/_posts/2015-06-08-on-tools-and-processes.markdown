My bad habit of trying to obsessively optimize everything has recently reared
its ugly head at work. Lately, I’ve been working on fine-tuning the development
tools that I use each day. At first, it was glorious; faster text editing and
amazing shortcuts. But it quickly became an obsession, and the changes weren’t
really making me more productive. I’d find myself adjusting my text editor more
than I was actually coding. I was messing around with new web frameworks instead
of actually implementing my idea.

At the apex of this insanity, I stumbled upon this quote:

> Eventually what helped me get past [obsessive optimization] is learning to be
> OK with the idea that your tools are sub-optimal, because they will always be
> sub-optimal, no matter how much time you spend bikeshedding them. There's

Now I realize that this probably sounds ridiculous. _”Dude just stop worrying
about this and write some code!”_ But for me, it’s easy to get lost in this
vortex. It’s essentially a form of procrastination with a bit of self-doubt
sprinkled on top. Instead of working on solving a hard problem with a
probably-crappy solution, I’ll fiddle around with settings so that I can choose
a font with better readability. I’ll subconsciously convince myself that my
solution won’t be perfect, and therefore it must be my tools that are the
problem. Rinse, repeat.

But why the fuck am I calling my solution crappy when I haven’t even written it
yet?! This doesn’t make sense, and needs to stop. Maybe I can try and introduce
some zen? On a forum discussing this topic, one user cited the Tao te Ching:

> Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt. Chase after money and security

Do the work, and step back. Going for the perfect solution on the first try is a
valiant effort, but probably unrealistic. Get something down and worry about
fixing it when it becomes a problem.

What I find most interesting is how with my other hobby, photography, I don’t
run into this problem at all. I have a Canon 5DmkII, that’s been out since 2008.
It’s a camera that has been retired from the market for two years, yet it can
still take beautiful images. It’s a little slow to take burst shots, and is
sometimes grainy in low light, but I really don’t mind. I’m able to completely
ignore the weaknesses of my tools and concentrate on _actually taking photos_
rather than obsessing over gear.

Time Ferris said it better than I can in one of his podcasts (episode 63, minute
28):

Vim will always be able to edit text, and a 5DmkII will always be able to snap a
pic. In their respective fields, these two tools have been boiled down to their
essence. They stay out of your way and allow you to create. The latest and
greatest tools may be shinier, they may have more bells and whistles, but if
you’re too busy fooling around with nobs and plugins you’re not making anything.
Do the work, and step back.
