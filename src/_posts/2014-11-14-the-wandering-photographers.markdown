After graduating, my good friends [Ted](http://tedrysz3.com/),
[Emily](http://emilyshearing.com/), and I started a photography project that we
called [The Wandering Photographers](http://thewanderingphotographers.com/). The
project was a wonderful way for us to document our lives on opposite coasts of
the US. Many people showed interest in the project, and all three of us shared
some of our favorite images on the site. Today, I'm re-releasing the project in
it's new form, and I couldn't be more excited.


### a new era

The Wandering Photographers grew amazingly when it was just Ted, Emily, and I
posting, but I wanted the project to grow even more. It is today that I'm proud
to announce that the photo project is now open source! This means that anyone in
the world is free to take the code, and their own images, and I will merge it
back in to the site.

I've written the site in Jekyll - which is a static-site generator. You can
create a new post by adding a markdown file and adding your images. Jekyll will
build a copy of the site and generate web-safe versions of your images.

I love the idea of anyone on the internet discovering the website and adding
their own images. Open source software is such a powerful methodology for
software, and now I'm bringing that thinking to a photography project.

I cannot wait to see your images.
