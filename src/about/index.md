Hey Thereâ€”

I'm currently an Infrastructure Engineer at Warby Parker.

After finishing my undergraduate degree at Syracuse University in 2013 I moved
to New York City to start my carreer in technology. Currently I'm a member of a
one person team that manages the development infrastructure, cloud instances,
and dev tooling at Warby Parker.

In my personal time, I enjoy [taking photos](https://365.becker.am),
building [silly and profane apps](https://github.com/Cbeck527), and
giving [talks](/talks/) at local meetups.

I enjoy working on passionate teams and breathing life into wacky ideas. I love
to combine technical and creative minds to see what can be built.
