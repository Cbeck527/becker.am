Hey There

I'm currently an Infrastructure Engineer at Warby Parker, an eyewear company transforming the industry.

After finishing my undergraduate degree at Syracuse University I moved to New York City to start my carreer in technology. Currently I'm a member of a two person team that manages the infrastructure, cloud instances, and developer technologies at Warby Parker.

I enjoy working on passionate teams and breathing life into wacky ideas. I love to combine technical and creative minds to see what can be built.
